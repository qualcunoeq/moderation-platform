# Introduction to the Moderation Platform

Welcome to the documentation for our Content Moderation API, a robust and customizable solution designed to keep your online spaces safe and compliant with your specific rules.

Our platform offers an automated moderation service that goes beyond simply identifying generally offensive content. It empowers you to define **personalized guidelines for your servers, forums, or groups**. This means moderation will precisely adapt to your needs, flagging only what violates *your* specific rules.

## What Our API Does
* Analyzes text content for potential rule violations.
* Classifies content based on predefined categories (e.g., hate speech, sexual content).
* **Evaluates content against your custom guidelines.**
* Provides detailed moderation logs for auditing and analysis.

## Key Benefits
* Automated and scalable moderation.
* **Customizable rules for tailored moderation.**
* Easy integration with your existing platforms.
* Detailed logs for audit and analysis.

## How It Works
(Brief overview of the flow: User sends text -> AI evaluates based on your custom rules -> API responds with moderation results and specific violations.)
